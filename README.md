### Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Use the following command to clone the ProjectName repository:

git cloneÂ https://github.com/your-username/Runoogers.git

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### Configuration

1. Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

cd Runoogers

2. **Configuration Step 1: Setting Up Environment Variables**

   To configure the project, you need to set up environment variables. Follow these steps:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
   - Add the necessary environment variables to the `.env` file. For example:

     ```plaintext
     API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
     FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
     ```

   - Ensure that the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.

3. **Configuration Step 2: Creating Configuration Files**

   If there are additional configuration steps, outline them here:

   - **Firebase Configuration:**

     - Create a `firebase_config.json` file in the `assets` directory.
     - Add your Firebase configuration details to the `firebase_config.json` file. For example:

       ```json
       {
         "apiKey": "your_firebase_api_key_here",
         "authDomain": "your_project_id.firebaseapp.com",
         "projectId": "your_project_id",
         "storageBucket": "your_project_id.appspot.com",
         "messagingSenderId": "your_messaging_sender_id",
         "appId": "your_app_id"
       }
       ```

   - **Google Maps API Configuration:**

     - Create a `google_maps_config.json` file in the `assets` directory.
     - Add your Google Maps API key to the `google_maps_config.json` file. For example:

       {
         "apiKey": "your_google_maps_api_key_here"
       }
       ```

   - **Loading Configuration Files:**
     - Ensure that your application loads these configuration files at runtime. You can use a package like `flutter_dotenv` to load environment variables and custom code to load JSON configuration files.

4. Install the required dependencies using:

flutter pub get
